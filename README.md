# pfdtools

A PyQt5 implementation of basic pdf merging and manipulation tools.
Buying an Adobe subscription just to merge a couple documents didn't seem worth it.
Based on the PyPdf2 package.

# Features

* Drag and drop files into application
* Merge files to your heart's content
* Errors are color coded
* Files can also be rotated

# Important Note

In order for the rotation to work the "PdfMerger" class of the PyPdf2 package was edited (only slightly). The edited file can be found in the "PyPDF2-edits" folder.
